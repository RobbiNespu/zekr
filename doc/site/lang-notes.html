This page contains a small tutorial plus some tips for language pack translators.
</i>

<br>
<p>
From <i>Zekr 0.1.0</i>, there is language pack support, which means that
one can easily change the user interface language in his own language.
</p>
<p>
Although this is quite easy to write a language pack, there are some
tips that translators should take into consideration.
The following are some tips about it:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Specify direction; Arabic like languages (Arabic, Farsi, Urdu) are 
  written <i>right to left</i> unlike Roman characters (English, French).
  </li>
  <li>Specify your language ID and your country (e.g. &quot;en&quot;
  as language ID and
  &quot;US&quot; as the country). The latter should be written
  in capital letters.
  </li>
  <li>Use UTF-8 compliant editors. Some good editors are: <b>Notepad</b>, 
  <b>SCUniPad</b>, <b>Frontpage</b>, <b>MS Word</b>, <b>KWrite</b>, and etc.</li>
  <li>Please check this page out periodically to see if there is a newer 
  English (reference) language pack. Because the software is growing there
  are bunch of new words and sentences with a minor release.
  Here are some links to current language packs available on CVS. You can
  download your own and see if there are new words waiting for the meaning!
  New words are highlighted with 3 spaces after value attribute
  and before closing the tag.
  By default the English meaning is put for all 
  language packs when a new word is added. Here is an example:
  <pre>&lt;text id="QUESTION" value="Question"   /&gt;</pre>
  </li>
  <li>The current English language pack is 
  <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/*checkout*/zekr/Zekr/res/lang/english.xml?content-type=text%2Fplain">here</a>.
  Other available language packs are <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/zekr/Zekr/res/lang/">here</a>.
  </li>
</ul>
