Zekr 0.1.0 FAQ
This is Frequently Asked Questions for the Zekr project.

[General]
What is Zekr?
	Zekr is an open platform for working on the Holly Quran. For more details
	see a list of features here {{link to features}}. Also you can find answers
	to your questions about the Holly Quran here {{link to Quran FAQ}}.

What does Zekr mean?
	Zekr is a name for the Holly Quran (in Quran terms). Linguistically, it means "note",
	"reminder" or "message". More clearly, Quran is a reminder for the human morality.

Where is the homepage?
	The main homepage for zekr is http://siahe.com/zekr, which is updated with the latest
	builds of Zekr. There is also a secondary home page on the leading hosting service for open source
	projects: sourceforge.net. The url is http://zekr.sourceforge.net. It may not update as
	fast as siahe.com. Conventionally package naming is of the form net.sf.zekr.*.

How can I contribute?
	See the page here {{link to contribution form [quranic resources, feature requests, donations, language pack]}}.

Who develops it?
	Zekr is originally written and being developed by Mohsen Saboorian {{link to khorshid}}.
	There are other	people working on it:
	+ Amir K. Dezfuli (Quran Linguistics, Grammatical System)
	+ Mohammad Taha Karami (Consultant)
	Special Thanks to
	+ Mohammad Mehdi Saboorian (Technical consultant) {{link to homepage}}

Why are you working on Zekr?
	There is not a really nice and standard platform for Quran related topics. There are some software
	which are fully commercial, others are free-commercial but no source code available.
	I didn't find such standard and up to date platform. If you know one, tell us {{link to contact form}}.

Which license is Zekr distributed under?
	For now, GNU GPL. You can find more information about licenses at release notes page {{link to release note page}}.

Where can I more information?
	You can contact us by following contact link {{link to contact}} of Zekr homepage.

[Developer]
What is Zekr written in?
	Zekr is written in Java (JDK 1.4+ compliant). It is developed in Eclipse
	platform (3.0 to 3.1M4) {{link to eclipse.org}}.

Which GUI library is used?
	Zekr is fully developed on SWT (Standard Widget Toolkit) {{link to swt home}}. Since it is not
	included in the standard Sun's JDK, you need to have swt-win32-xxxx.dll for Win32 machines or
	libswt-gtk-xxxx.so/libswt-pi-gtk-xxxx.so for your Linux/GTK platforms. There is also a platform
	specific jar file on the project's lib directory named swt.jar.

[Install]
I downloaded Zekr. Now, what should I do?
	Please note that there are two releases for each version of zekr for any platforms. One is
	"sa" (standalone) version which is a large (~5MB) file. If you downloaded this file, you can
	unpack and run it either if you don't have a JRE (Java Runtime Environment) installed on
	your computer. It's quite easy , just run the zekr.exe file located on the root installation
	path.
	There is also another smaller version available which is only proper for IT professionals!
	It is just a jar file + .bat/.sh files for running it on JRE.
	
	For now there is only platform independent jar file available. You may easily run Zekr under
	Win32 platform by running run.bat at the root installation directory. In order to run Zekr,
	you must have JRE 1.4 or later, and have java.exe in your path environment variable.

I've seen an XP style screenshot of Zekr, but my copy is not in XP theme. What should I do?
	It is mainly about the GUI toolkit used for Zekr (SWT). It supports XP theme, but you should
	do something manually. Get ready? Let's go:
	Make sure where the java.exe in your path is. Some probabilities are:
	[Windows]/system32/java.exe
	[JAVA_HOME]/bin/java.exe
	[Program Files]/java/j2re1.4.x/bin/java.exe
	You should copy the file java.exe.manifest (located at [zekr]/res) near the java.exe.
	That's all.
