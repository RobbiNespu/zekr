As salamu alaikum mohsen,

I think, if you could similar to bookmarks a notes module, where we can make
individual notes with formats (bold, underline, italic, list etc.)

With

- folders
- sub folders

This would a great feature.

In this module I could write or paste from word some text material which I
could use in speeches or so. like "sabab nuzul" or annotations to surah or
verse, or to different topics.

I think you could save this data as txt file in folders.

Please make a test, if this is possible.

The bookmark think is wonderful, you can make the notes module similar to
this, but only text and may be internal links to the surah / verse; mean
when I click on the ayah (12/10) it should go to this one.
--> additional feature !!!

May Allah (t.) bless you in dunya and hereafter with this great work

Sincerly

dursun
