Zekr Notes. Rev. 0.1

Quran Text File Spec.
	All the XML file specifications are applicable to the text file, and 
	should be changed from a file to file.
	Each Quran Text File should have 3 lines for every suras, so the file
	MUST have exactly 114*3=342 lines plus an optional line break at the
	end of the 342th line.
	The first line of a sura is its title, consisting of the name, number
	and some optional informations. The second line always should hava a
	Bismillah..., and the third line is the whole sura.
	
	Juz sign must be located at the start of a juz of the Quran.

XML files:
	Zekr should have a class named as *Naming.java (e.g. LanguageNaming.java)
	for each xml file. These classes have constant properties standing for xml
	attributes and elements. each constnt should end either in _TAG or _ATTR
	according to being tag (node, element) or attribute.
	
Arrays!
   Each array in the source code is counted from 0. So all array reletad
   entities - such as ayas, or suras - are stored in an array from index 0.
   There only a small transformation will be done in the view layer
   (input or output).
/*
Form view state
	Each form in the application will have a view state associated with it.
	view state will hold all necessary states for inputs (such as text boxes,
	combo boxes, radio buttons, and other components). View state is a singleton
	class which is created as the form is loaded first time so that one can easily
	access to form's current state.
	The naming convention is [main form .java class name] + "View": e.g.
	QuranForm + View = QuranFormView*/
